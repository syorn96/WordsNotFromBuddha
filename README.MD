# Words Not From Buddha

## Project Idea and Description

Words have the power to create or break a person's reality. 
Words Not From Buddha is inspired by moments of clarity that I've experienced through reading meaningful words strung together. This online application will generate random quotes from ZenQuotes API (often related to inspiration, motivation, or life truths) in order to stimulate the user's ability to meditate, reflect or create intentions. Users that sign up will also receive a FREE daily horoscope through Aztro API.

My goal is to create a virtual space for users to just "Zen Out".

Special thanks to my dear friend, Sean Agcaoili.
This web application is a tribute to our friendship and the moments where we would light incense, meditate and reflect on our lives.

WNFB will allow users to:
* Meditate - Users will scroll through a list of random generated quotes and add it to their account.
* Reflect - Users will add reflections to their saved quotes.
* Intention - Users will display a single quote through a virtual vision board and "manifest it" into their lives.

## Post Project Reflection
* I learned to appreciate asking for help when I really got stumped, but to also take a step back and prioritize my time-wisely. Once I took a step back, I was able to revisit my issue with a refreshed mindset. 
* I also learned that I really enjoy creating and sharing things that Iâ€™m passionate about, so if I were ever to make my own start-up - I would want it to be an idea or company that I can truly stand by.
* I had to revisit some methods that I haven't used for a couple of weeks and tweak it to my application needs.
