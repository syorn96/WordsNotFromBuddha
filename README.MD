# Words Not From Buddha

## Link to Web Application

## Project Idea and Description

Words have the power to create or break a person's reality. 
Words Not From Buddha is inspired by moments of clarity that I've experienced through reading meaningful words strung together. This online application will generate random quotes from ZenQuotes API (often related to inspiration, motivation, or life truths) in order to stimulate the user's ability to meditate, reflect or create intentions. Users that sign up will also receive a FREE daily horoscope through Aztro API.

My goal is to create a virtual space for users to just "Zen Out".

Special thanks to my dear friend, Sean Agcaoili.
This web application is a tribute to our friendship and the moments where we would light incense, meditate and reflect on our lives.

WNFB will allow users to:
* Meditate - Users will scroll through a list of random generated quotes and add it to their account.
* Reflect - Users will add reflections to their saved quotes.
* Intention - Users will display a single quote through a virtual vision board and "manifest it" into their lives.

## Approach Taken

When creating this application, I kept asking myself the question "what would a user appreciate in an application like this?"

This allowed me to have a birds-eyed view and incorporate features that would add to the user's experience. Ex: (User account settings and the ability to delete data that's saved in the local databases)

I used all the node module packages that we learned in Unit 2 (at General Assembly) and some "onclick" functions that I incorporated in my first project "Lucky Duck".

I also wanted this application to be personal to the user and remind them that sometimes it's healthy to dedicate self-reflection time.

## Techstack

* Javascript (Coding language used)
* CSS (Styling)
* HTML (Webpage)
* Node (Download other Node Module Packages)
* Axios (Grab data from API)
* Postgresql (Tool for database)
* Sequelize (Object Relational Mapper)
* Express (route controllers)
* Bcrypt (encrypt user password)
* Cookie-Parser (used to encrypt cookie id)
* Crypto-JS (encrypt user/cookie id on webpage)
* Dotenv (Create secret key)
* EJS (Embedded javascript templates)
* Express-EJS-Layouts (Partial and webpage layouts)
* Method-Override (PUT and DELETE methods)

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to create an account, login and logout.
* As a user, I want to view quotes and add it to my account.
* As a user, I want to view and delete the quotes I saved.
* As a user, I want to create, edit and delete reflections for each quote.
* As a user, I want to view a single quote and display it on a virtual vision board.

## MVP
* A display for all quotes (meditate)
* A display for all saved quotes (reflect)
* A display for a single quote (intention)
* Functioning routes
* Functioning forms to create, delete, or update reflections per quote.
* Functioning forms to delete or add quotes to reflect page.

## Stretchgoals
* Add second API (horoscopes)
* Add and display username + horoscope
* Allow users to edit their profile (username, email, password, birthday)
* Add a toggle button to change website theme (Yin/Yang)
* Delete all saved information when a user is deleted
* Make app mobile-friendly

## Potential Roadblocks
* Associating mutliple models
* CSS
* Converting app tobe mobile-friendly

## Post Project Reflection
* I learned to appreciate asking for help when I really got stumped, but to also take a step back and prioritize my time-wisely. Once I took a step back, I was able to revisit my issue with a refreshed mindset. 
* I also learned that I really enjoy creating and sharing things that Iâ€™m passionate about, so if I were ever to create my own start-up - I would want it to be an idea or company that I can truly stand by.
* I had to revisit some coding methods that I haven't used for a couple of weeks and tweak it to my application needs.
* I will have to revisit making this application mobile friendly using media queries.
